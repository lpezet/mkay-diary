THis is a test.
Here I talk about toto, titi, and tata.

This is also a test. But I only talk about tutu here.

## Entry for 06/06/21

Decided today to spice things up a bit.
Some ideas:

- Some static part of the diary: things that can be edited but outside the normal daily entries.
- Maybe concat all entries WITHIN say the Readme.md (like doctoc). In this case some template/tags are just needed and the static part is just whatever's in the Readme.md already. This should be easy to do with say `sed`.
- Decided to rename boring "my-diary" to something more...different: "mkay-diary", with the binary being "mkay", m'kay?

For #2 above, tags could simply be `START mkay-diary` and `END mkay-diary`, and be replaced by `START mkay-diary generated diary please keep comment here to allow auto update` and `END mkay-diary` (unchanged) respectively, with the content in between.

Need to convert `mkay` from `bash` to `nodejs` (`typescript` of course).
This will allow from better handling of files (tags, replacing, etc.) but more importantly easier, more efficient, cross-platform, and most importantly, more testable.
