## 06/26/2021 - Refeactoring and logs

### Refactoring

Need to refactor a couple of commands to make them more testable.
Somehow Sinon doesn't seem to stub *global* methods like "open" from the open npm package, or "exec" from child_process.
Must define some simple methods for Entry command, as such:

```js
export type ChildProcessInfo = {
  readonly stdout?: string;
  readonly stderr?: string;
  readonly killed?: boolean;
  readonly pid?: number;
  readonly exitCode?: number | null;
  readonly signalCode?: NodeJS.Signals | null;
};

export type Deps = {
  open: (command: string) => Promise<ChildProcessInfo>;
  exec: (command: string) => Promise<ChildProcessInfo>;
};
```

Same for `Full` command as it reads a bunch of files and write to one file:

```js
export type Deps = {
  createWriteStream: typeof fs.createWriteStream;
  createReadStream: typeof fs.createReadStream;
};
```

Constructor for those classes will then look like:

```js
constructor(pConfig: Config, pDeps: Deps) {
    this.config = pConfig;
    this.deps = pDeps;
}
```

...in which case the `src/main/index.ts` must be updated accordingly (using open, exec and fs functions for implementations).

### Log file

Log file should reside in Config.baseDir() (`.diary` by default).
