## Diary for 06/06/21

Decided today to spice things up a bit.
Some ideas:

- Some static part of the diary: things that can be edited but outside the normal daily entries.
- Maybe concat all entries WITHIN say the Readme.md (like doctoc). In this case some template/tags are just needed and the static part is just whatever's in the Readme.md already. This should be easy to do with say `sed`.
- Decided to rename boring "my-diary" to something more...different: "mkay-diary", with the binary being "mkay", m'kay?

For #2 above, tags could simply be:

```html
&lt;!-- START mkay-diary --&gt; &lt;!-- END mkay-diary --&gt;
```

and be replaced by:

```html
&lt;!-- START mkay-diary generated diary please keep comment here to allow auto
update --&gt; ...concatenated diary entries... &lt;!-- END mkay-diary generated
diary please keep comment here to allow auto update --&gt;
```
